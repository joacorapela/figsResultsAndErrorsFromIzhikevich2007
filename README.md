# Code to reproduce figures and errors from the book Izhikevich, E. Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience. MIT Press. 2007.

The code has been developed in Python 2.7.
It requires numpy, scipi and matplotlib.

The <a href=ipynb>ipynb</a> directory contains Jupyter notebooks and the <a href=scripts>scripts</a> directory contains scripts to reproduce figures in the book.

A large number of figures in the book have been reproduced in the <a href=scripts>scripts</a> directory and only a few of them have been reproduced in the <a href=ipynb>ipynb</a> directory (work in progress). The code is not very well organized (work in progress).
